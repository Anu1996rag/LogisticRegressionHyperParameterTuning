# Logistic Regression Hyper Parameter Tuning
This is to understand the concept of Parameter Tuning of Logistic Regression using GridSearchCV and understand the StreamLit library to build a data app.

In this project , I tried to understand the concept of **hyper parameter tuning in Logistic Regression**.</br>

Here , are the **list of libraries and techniques** I used to get it started.

1. Numpy 
2. Pandas
3. Iris Dataset
4. PCA 
5. Logistic Regression Model 
6. Pipeline
7. Cross-Validation 
8. Streamlit 

I have referred to the below video on YouTube to get it started.<br/>
Please do check out.<br/>
[Data Science Projects | Code tutorial| Python | Hyper-parameter tuning| 6. Logistic Reg. Gridsearch](https://youtu.be/Sak_XgE5AjM)

For building the above code into a data app , I have used **Streamlit** library.<br/>
This is an awesome library I have come up with.<br/>

Please pass in the below instruction on your terminal to install it.<br/>
<br/>
`pip install streamlit`
<br/>
<br/>
After installing , to make sure it has been successfully installed , run the below command.<br/>
<br/>
`streamlit hello`
<br/>
<br/>
This will automatically open a new tab in your browser.<br/>

Below is the link for streamlit documentation.<br/>
[Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/)
<br/>

But , I will recommend you to watch this video below which I referred by **Data Professor**.<br/>
[How to Build a Simple Machine Learning Web App in Python (Streamlit Tutorial Part 2)](https://youtu.be/8M20LyCZDOY)

To run the above the code , navigate to the folder through the terminal where the *.py* file is stored and enter the below command.<br/>
In this case ,<br/>
`streamlit run iris_classification.py`
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please go ahead and check out on yourself the magic of streamlit with just a few lines of code.:smile:
